## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design

### What I learned

This project helped me practice dynamic DOM manipulation, clipboard API usage, and visual feedback implementation using JavaScript. I also improved my skills in:

- Handling user input and form validation
- Customizing sliders with dynamic backgrounds using JS
- Providing feedback through signal strength indicators

Example: updating the slider background dynamically:

```js
function updateSliderBackground() {
    const value = (slider.value - slider.min) / (slider.max - slider.min) * 100;
    slider.style.background = \`linear-gradient(
      to right,
      var(--Green200) 0%,
      var(--Green200) \${value}%,
      var(--Grey850) \${value}%,
      var(--Grey850) 100%
    )\`;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to:

- Add a toggle to show/hide the generated password
- Improve password strength calculation by factoring in character variety
- Implement dark/light theme switcher
- Add unit tests for the password generation logic
